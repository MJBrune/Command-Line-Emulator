# Command-Line-Emulator

Based off of the requirements in this discussion thread

I wrote this as a quick and simple way to show writing a command line parser can be easy and simple. You could port this to linux but currently only works on windows due to the nature of the application. Something like this could be done much easier in SDL/UE4/Unity and be more universal as you would be creating your own console environment and dealing with just rendering the strings yourself.

Regular BSD license. Simply use this code for whatever.
